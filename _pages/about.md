# Welcome to My Academic Homepage

I am **Lingqi Meng**, a mathematician and machine learning scientist currently serving as a **Lecturer at Yanbian University (延边大学)**. My research focuses on **Machine Learning and Bioinformatics**, particularly developing computational methods for analyzing complex biological data and networks.  

I received my **Ph.D. in Mathematics** under the supervision of **Naoki Masuda** at the **State University of New York at Buffalo** in 2022. After completing my Ph.D., I held postdoctoral positions at:  
- **KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska högskolan), 2022–2024**, supervised by **Adil Mardinoglu**  
- **University of Münster (Universität Münster), July–November 2024**, supervised by **Christina Lill**  

Since July 2025, I have been a **Lecturer at Yanbian University**, where I continue to pursue research at the intersection of mathematics, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
