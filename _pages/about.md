I am Lingqi Meng, a mathematician and machine learning scientist currently serving as a lecturer at Yanbian University (延边大学). My research focuses on machine learning and bioinformatics, particularly developing computational methods for analyzing complex biological data and networks.

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics under the supervision of [Naoki Masuda](https://naokimas.github.io/naokimasuda.github.io/) at the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2022. After completing my Ph.D., I held postdoctoral positions at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska högskolan) from 2022 to 2024, supervised by [Adil Mardinoglu](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/people/adil-mardinoglu), and at the University of Münster (Universität Münster) from July to November 2024, supervised by [Christina Lill](https://www.medizin.uni-muenster.de/epi/institut/mitarbeiter/univ-prof-dr-med-christina-lill-translationale-epidemiologie.html).

Since July 2025, I have been a lecturer at Yanbian University, where I continue to pursue research at the intersection of mathematics, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
