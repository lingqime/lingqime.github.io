I am Lingqi Meng, a mathematician and machine learning scientist currently serving as a lecturer at Yanbian University (延边大学). My research focuses on machine learning and bioinformatics, particularly developing computational methods for analyzing complex biological data and networks.

I received my Ph.D. in Mathematics under the supervision of Naoki Masuda at the State University of New York at Buffalo in 2022. After completing my Ph.D., I held postdoctoral positions at KTH Royal Institute of Technology (Kungliga Tekniska högskolan) from 2022 to 2024, supervised by Adil Mardinoglu, and at the University of Münster (Universität Münster) from July to November 2024, supervised by Christina Lill.

Since July 2025, I have been a lecturer at Yanbian University, where I continue to pursue research at the intersection of mathematics, machine learning, and bioinformatics.
