I am thrilled to share some exciting news — our latest work, **“Pan-disease atlas maps molecular fingerprints of health, disease and aging,”** has just been published in ***Science***! 🧬✨  

This study represents a major collaborative effort to build the **Human Disease Blood Atlas**, which maps how thousands of proteins in human blood shift across 59 diseases, aging, and health. By comparing molecular signatures across conditions, we aim to distinguish **universal inflammatory responses** from **truly disease-specific biomarkers**, paving the way toward more reliable and reproducible diagnostics.  

I feel truly honored and grateful to have worked with such an incredible team — some of the most brilliant, inspiring, and generous scientists I’ve ever met in my life. Collaborating on this project has been one of the most rewarding experiences of my research journey.  

This work would not have been possible without the leadership of **Prof. Mathias Uhlén**, the first author **María Bueno Álvez**, and all the amazing collaborators from the **Human Protein Atlas** community.
