I am delighted to share that, starting from **July 1st, 2025**, I have officially joined the **Department of Science at Yanbian University** to continue my academic career.  

My future research will primarily focus on two exciting and rapidly evolving areas:  

1. **Graph Neural Networks (GNNs)** – a powerful deep learning framework that extends neural networks to non-Euclidean data structures such as graphs, enabling breakthroughs in social network analysis, chemistry, and knowledge representation.  
2. **Bioinformatics** – an interdisciplinary field at the intersection of biology and computation, where I aim to apply advanced machine learning techniques to uncover insights from complex biological data.  

I am enthusiastic about exploring how **graph-based models** can be leveraged to address fundamental problems in **life sciences**, particularly in understanding molecular interactions, disease mechanisms, and personalized medicine.  

This transition marks not only a new stage of my academic journey but also a great opportunity to collaborate with colleagues and students who share similar research interests. I look forward to contributing to the vibrant research community at Yanbian University and beyond.  

If you are interested in **graph neural networks, bioinformatics, or potential collaborations**, please feel free to reach out — I would be more than happy to exchange ideas.
